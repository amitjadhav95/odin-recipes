    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>A short and Sweet recipe. This naan bread pizza recipe is one of my favorite Friday night dishes. This pizza is
        quick, simple, and
        delicious. Instead of making the pizza dough from scratch, I decided to use naan bread for the pizza base. Using
        naan bread saves time and is also great for portion control. The only difference between this recipe and most
        pizza recipes is that it doesn't include tomato sauce on the base. I don't like the sogginess that comes from
        the sauce but feel free to try it with the sauce, as it will still yield good results. You can find out more on
