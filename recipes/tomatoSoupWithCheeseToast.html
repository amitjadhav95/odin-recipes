    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>We're doing a very fresh twist on the classic cream of tomato soup with a grilled cheese sandwich. Since we're
        using fresh tomatoes at their peak of vine-ripened goodness, this simple soup is going to be not quite, but
        almost, 100% tomato. You can find out more on <strong><a href="https://www.allrecipes.com" target="_blank"

    <h2><u>Ingredients:</u></h2>
     
    <h3>Tomato Soup:</h3>
    <ul>      
        <li>3 ½ pounds vine-ripened tomatoes
        </li>
        <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter
        </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil
        </li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced
        </li>
        <li>1 anchovy fillet
        </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
        </li>
        <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes (Optional)
        </li>

        <li><strong>Cheese Toast:</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Cheese Toast:</h3>
    <ul>   
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil
        </li>
        <li>8 slices Italian bread
        </li>
        <li>¼ cup thinly sliced basil leaves
        </li>
        <li>6 ounces shredded sharp white Cheddar cheese
        </li> 
    </ul>
    <h2><u>Steps:</u></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the tomato soup: Remove cores from tomatoes and cut in half crosswise. Reserve until needed.
        </li>
        <li>Heat butter and olive oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add garlic and anchovy and cook until garlic is sizzling in the hot fat, 45 seconds to 1 minute. Carefully add tomatoes with their juices, salt, and red pepper flakes. Toss with a spoon every few minutes until tomatoes release their liquid and start to break down.     
        </li>
        <li>Once tomatoes have softened and started to collapse, reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes have fallen apart and the soup resembles a coarse tomato sauce, about 45 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, prepare the cheese toast: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with foil or a silicone liner. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons olive oil.
        </li>
        <li>Place bread slices on the prepared baking sheet. Top each slice with sliced basil, and then Cheddar cheese.
        </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the cheese is well browned and crispy around the edges, 15 to 20 minutes. Let cool to room temperature.
        </li>
        <li>Remove soup from heat and pass through a mesh strainer into a bowl. Use the back of a ladle to push all the tomato mixture through. Discard the skins and seeds, which should be the only things left in the strainer.
        </li>
        <li>Transfer the strained tomato soup back into the saucepan and place back over medium-low heat. Continue cooking to thicken slightly, if desired, or simply bring back to a simmer and serve immediately with the cheese toasts. <br><br>
