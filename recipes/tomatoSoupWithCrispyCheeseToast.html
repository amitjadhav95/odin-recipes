            <h2>Description:</h2>
            <p>We're doing a very fresh twist on the classic cream of tomato soup with a grilled cheese sandwich. Since
                we're
                using fresh tomatoes at their peak of vine-ripened goodness, this simple soup is going to be not quite,
                but
                almost, 100% tomato. You can find out more on <strong><a href="https://www.allrecipes.com"

            <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
            <h3>Tomato Soup:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>3 ½ pounds vine-ripened tomatoes
                </li>
                <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter
                </li>
                <li>2 tablespoons olive oil
                </li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, minced
                </li>
                <li>1 anchovy fillet
                </li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
                </li>
                <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes (Optional)
                </li>
            </ol>
            <br>

            <h3>Cheese Toast:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>2 tablespoons olive oil
                </li>
                <li>8 slices Italian bread
                </li>
                <li>¼ cup thinly sliced basil leaves
                </li>
                <li>6 ounces shredded sharp white Cheddar cheese
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2 class="stepsHeading"><u>Steps:</u></h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare the tomato soup: Remove cores from tomatoes and cut in half crosswise. Reserve until needed.
                </li>
                <li>Heat butter and olive oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add garlic and anchovy and cook until
                    garlic
                    is sizzling in the hot fat, 45 seconds to 1 minute. Carefully add tomatoes with their juices, salt,
                    and
                    red
                    pepper flakes. Toss with a spoon every few minutes until tomatoes release their liquid and start to
                    break
                    down.
                </li>
                <li>Once tomatoes have softened and started to collapse, reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring
                    occasionally, until tomatoes have fallen apart and the soup resembles a coarse tomato sauce, about
                    45
                    minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Meanwhile, prepare the cheese toast: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a
                    baking
                    sheet
                    with foil or a silicone liner. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons olive oil.
                </li>
                <div class="stepsImg">

                        alt="Tomato Soup with Toast Img2">
                </div>

                <li>Place bread slices on the prepared baking sheet. Top each slice with sliced basil, and then Cheddar
                    cheese.
                </li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the cheese is well browned and crispy around the edges, 15 to 20
                    minutes.
                    Let cool to room temperature.
                </li>
                <li>Remove soup from heat and pass through a mesh strainer into a bowl. Use the back of a ladle to push
                    all
                    the
                    tomato mixture through. Discard the skins and seeds, which should be the only things left in the
                    strainer.
                </li>
                <li>Transfer the strained tomato soup back into the saucepan and place back over medium-low heat.
                    Continue
                    cooking to thicken slightly, if desired, or simply bring back to a simmer and serve immediately with
                    the
                    cheese toasts.
                </li>
