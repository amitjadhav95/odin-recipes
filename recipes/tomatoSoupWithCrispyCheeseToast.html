                <h2>Description:</h2>
                <p>We're doing a very fresh twist on the classic cream of tomato soup with a grilled cheese sandwich.
                    Since
                    we're
                    using fresh tomatoes at their peak of vine-ripened goodness, this simple soup is going to be not
                    quite,
                    but
                    almost, 100% tomato. You can find out more on <strong><a href="https://www.allrecipes.com"

                <h3>Cheese Toast:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil
                    </li>
                    <li>8 slices Italian bread
                    </li>
                    <li>¼ cup thinly sliced basil leaves
                    </li>
                    <li>6 ounces shredded sharp white Cheddar cheese

            <div class="recipeSteps">
                <h2 class="stepsHeading"><u>Steps:</u></h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Prepare the tomato soup: Remove cores from tomatoes and cut in half crosswise. Reserve until
                        needed.
                    </li>
                    <li>Heat butter and olive oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add garlic and anchovy and cook
                        until
                        garlic
                        is sizzling in the hot fat, 45 seconds to 1 minute. Carefully add tomatoes with their juices,
                        salt,
                        and
                        red
                        pepper flakes. Toss with a spoon every few minutes until tomatoes release their liquid and start
                        to
                        break
                        down.
                    </li>
                    <li>Once tomatoes have softened and started to collapse, reduce heat to medium-low and cook,
                        stirring
                        occasionally, until tomatoes have fallen apart and the soup resembles a coarse tomato sauce,
                        about
                        45
                        minutes.
                    </li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, prepare the cheese toast: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a
                        baking
                        sheet
                        with foil or a silicone liner. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons olive oil.
                    </li>
                    <li class="stepsImg">

                            alt="Tomato Soup with Toast Img2">
                    </li>

                    <li>Place bread slices on the prepared baking sheet. Top each slice with sliced basil, and then
                        Cheddar
                        cheese.
                    </li>
                    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the cheese is well browned and crispy around the edges, 15 to
                        20
                        minutes.
                        Let cool to room temperature.
                    </li>
                    <li>Remove soup from heat and pass through a mesh strainer into a bowl. Use the back of a ladle to
                        push
                        all
                        the
                        tomato mixture through. Discard the skins and seeds, which should be the only things left in the
                        strainer.
                    </li>
                    <li>Transfer the strained tomato soup back into the saucepan and place back over medium-low heat.
                        Continue
                        cooking to thicken slightly, if desired, or simply bring back to a simmer and serve immediately
                        with
                        the
                        cheese toasts.
